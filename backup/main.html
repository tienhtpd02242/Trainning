<h3>How should insurers treat a risk that has a mid-term endorsement which means the eligibility of the risk changes? (e.g. a SME risk changing from $4m sum insured to $6m)</h3>
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">If the risk is no longer eligible at mid-term endorsement, the pool will not cover the risk for the remaining policy term. The insurer should provide the transaction as a pro-rata refund of the ARPC reinsurance premium in the movement report.  If the risk becomes eligible mid-term, the pool will cover the risk from the endorsement date and the insurer should include the risk in the movement file, paying ARPC the reinsurance premium for the remaining policy term.
